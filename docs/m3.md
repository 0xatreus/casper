# M3 Intelligence and Prioritization

## Goal

Move from findings generator to risk engine.

## M3 Deliverables

### Fingerprinting with confidence
- Record raw signals and confidence weights.
- Store version confidence separately from detection confidence.

### CVE correlation (evidence-first)
- Correlate only when version confidence is strong.
- Prefer "likely vulnerable" over unsupported certainty.

### Risk scoring
- severity x exploitability x exposure x asset criticality
- Include business context: owner, data sensitivity, internet exposure.

## Data Model Additions (Suggested)

- FingerprintSignal table with weights and evidence.
- RiskScore table tied to Finding or Scan.
- Asset context fields on Target (criticality, owner, tags).

## Definition of Done

- Default output answers: "What should we fix first this week?"
- CVE correlations are conservative and evidence-based.
